Welcome to use this TinySQL interpreter!

To run the program:

--First, start by running Main.java.

--Second choose the way of inputting TinySQL statements. 

  Selection "A" allows you to input the file name and the system starts to execute statements line by line. If you want to output the result to a file, please note that you need to put the file under the TinySQL program path and add a "Exit" at the end of your statement file to exit. The result of execution will be saved to a file named "result.txt";

  Selection "B" allows you to input one TinySQL statement by lines. 

  The system will stop running and exit at any time when you input "Exit".
